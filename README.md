# 👩‍⚕️🐶 Patient Tracking Vet

This project is a Patient Tracking System for veterinary clinics, built with modern web technologies. The app allows veterinary professionals to efficiently manage and track patient information such as the pet’s name, owner details, email, admission date, and symptoms.

## :star2: Features
- **Add New Patient Data:** Input the patient's name, owner's name, contact email, admission date, and symptoms for easy tracking.
- **Edit Patient Data:** Modify any patient or owner information at any time.
- **Delete Patient Data:** Remove outdated or unnecessary records from the system.

## :pushpin: Technologies Used
- **React (with TypeScript)** for building the user interface.
- **Vite** as the build tool for faster and more optimized development.
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive styling.

## :ok_hand: Performance Optimization

To enhance performance, I implemented:

- **Zustand** – Lightweight state management for efficient updates and reactivity.
- **React Hook Form** – Provides optimized form handling and validation with minimal re-renders.
- **React Toastify** – For easy-to-use, customizable notifications.
- **UUID** – To ensure unique patient IDs for tracking.
- **LocalStorage** – Data persistence, enabling the app to store patient information across browser sessions.
